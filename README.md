# endless-sky gravity mod

This is a fork from endless-sky to experiment with newtonian gravity gameplay. I have recording some [in-game footage](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6y1lhPS7VxGBoYPHP93PyfDxroHOoiBU) with active gravity.

The fork is not maintained and was mainly done to get a feel for the ES code base and play a bit around with physics in the game :)
